I have created a 3 file simulation of the solar heating system displayed in the directions.
This system creates a solar panel object that contains the surface temperature of the panel in degrees fahrenheit,
the surface area of the panel in square feet, and the capacity of water the panel can hold in gallons. A water
tank object is then created which contains the temperature of the water in the tank in degrees fahrenheit
and the capacity of the tank in gallons.

The pump pumps water at a rate specified from the tank to the panel and back to the tank. After each time step
the increased temperature of the water leaving the panel is calculated and the new temperature of the tank is calculated.
I have little experience in thermodynamics so the convection rate of heat may be slightly off; however, this is a
simple simulation of the system given.

The constants at the beginning of main can be changed to fit different scenarios.
